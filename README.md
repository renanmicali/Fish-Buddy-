# FishBuddy-Yelp

<p>In this project i created a full CRUD aplication using:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Ejs</li>
<li>NODE</li>
<li>Mongo ( database )</li>
<li>Other npm packages (check app.js) </li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to create an APP that people can use to share fishing spots and classify this places with reviews. </p>

<p>First and longest part was to create a working application for the user implementing: creation, means to update and delete ''fishingspost''</p>

<p>After that styling using <b> Bootstrap v5 </b> and use <b> PASSPORT </b> for authentication of the user.</p>

<p>Once that was done adding a MAP and basics UI for the APP to look better in the users eyes. </p>

<p>Last step was deployment and connecting to portifolio.</p>
